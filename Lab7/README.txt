Part b)
    Based on the data calculated, the tree insert time is much slower with a
    large amount of data (around five times slower with 50,000 data entries).
    However, when dealing with a small amount of data (i.e. less than 5,000 
    data entries), the insert time and query time is relatively close to each
    other. 
    
    In terms of comparing the two data structures using other factors, I 
    could also measure the times between the two data structures used if the 
    data was sorted or unsorted. If measuring the times between unsorted and 
    sorted data, I would predict that the tree insert and query time would be 
    much faster than the hash table query and insert time.
